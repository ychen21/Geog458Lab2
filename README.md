# Geog458Lab2
## Search Topics: Wildlife Around UW Campus & Mircosoft in Seattle Area
In the beginning, I was thinking about researching wildlife information and food information around the UW campus because I volunteer at a wildlife shelter and we are also using a crawler for lab 2 in Geog450. However, after starting to create the word cloud in WordArt, I realized that the weight of the search is taken over by elements related to UW from other elements like "Food" or "Wildlife". As a result, I kept one of the word clouds related to UW and crawled another csv about Mircosoft in the Seattle area.   
For the Wildlife dataset, I picked the locations first with **latitude and longitude** because I want to see if wildlife is a topic around the UW campus(We do have lots of mallard friends). For the Mircosoft dataset, I used two independent keywords: **Microsoft** and **Seattle** because I want to see if Seattle will take over the weight of Microsoft and maybe see if the influence of UW may come over to Microsoft's videos. 

## Word Cloud Difference and Similarities
Some **similarities** the two-word clouds share is that both of them are somehow influenced by the weight of UW, despite the fact that UW is not mentioned at all when collecting data for the Microsoft dataset. Some words like game, football, and NFL appeared in both cloud words. Another similarity among all the four datasets I collected is that there are so many meaningless or words that just appeared once. The last similarity is that both datasets are influenced more by Geography related information like "Seattle" and "UW". We can see that words related to geoinformation tend to be bigger in the word cloud, just like why Seattle is bigger than Microsoft in the blue cloud bubble. I think the reason why the "UW" word outstanded "Wildlife" is that we are able to find more content related to UW than to wildlife. It may also be the YouTube recommendation system playing its trick, sending more videos about UW onto the top. 
The biggest **difference** I notice is that the Microsoft dataset experiences way less influence cast by UW. It also has more minor words related to Microsoft like AI, laptops, APP. I guess YouTubers will focus more on the content topic in their description, providing more details like talking about programming or developing AI. However, we can conclude that a high percentage of them will mention the word "Seattle". We can also predict that these two words appear together in many cases so that they share a distribution close to 50/50

## Improvement in the Future
This makes me think that maybe next time only counting the vocabulary from the titles will be a better idea to save time and we can use larger datasets too. Because video descriptions tend to be longer and contain way more noise, we get more meaningless and noisy vocab when collecting data. What's more, because the data are collected from YouTube, terminology related to YouTube such as subscription and follow are also high above in the lists.

## Something I expected
I thought I would get a 50/50 on the wildlife dataset, with half of the word related to wildlife and another half to UW. However, I guess not everybody cares about the animals around us and that is understandable. The influence and power of UW, especially our football games, are very strong. Because I am not a sports person at all, the fact that people are crazy about football really surprised me.
